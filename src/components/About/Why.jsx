            At EstateIQ, we make real estate simple, transparent, and
            stress-free. From essential legal documentation like sale deeds and
            Khata transfers, to rental management, property health checks, and
            even modular housing solutions â€” we offer end-to-end services for
            property owners, buyers, and investors.
            <br />
            <br /> Our mission is to bridge the gap between traditional property
            services and the future of PropTech by combining expertise, trust,
            and smart technology.
